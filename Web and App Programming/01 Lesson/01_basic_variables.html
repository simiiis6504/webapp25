        // what are vars typically used for?

        // answer: everything where you want to give a value a name, for example:

        let score=0;
        let gameTime=0;
        let totalSum=0;

        let myVariable = 1;
        
        myVariable++; // will work, because you can change the value of a variable

        console.log(myVariable); // logs 2

        //whenn you create a const inside of an event, its a new variable every time the event runs (so we aren ot reassigning an existing const)

        const myDivs= document.querySelectorAll(".myDiv"); // just selects the divs with that class (as in CSS)
        //const myDivs= document.querySelectorAll("div"); //selects all the divs

                   this.style.fontSize = "1rem"; //change it to 1rem // single equal assigns
               

               }
               
               else {
                this.style.color="red"; //changes the color of the text to red when clicked
                this.style.fontSize="5rem"; //changes the font size to 2em when clicked

                }
            });

                const myText = theDiv.textContent; //this const will be a new variable for each div, so we are NOT reassigning it even though it logs a different value on each iteration of the loop
                console.log (myText); // gets the text content of the div

        })

         //myDivs is a global variable, which means it is not wiped out when some function has been executed, which means that trying to assign to it again creates an error

        //myDivs = document.querySelectorAll('.somethingElse'); //throws an error

        //a const CAN have its properties altered (but just not reassigned)

        const myEmployeeObject = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,
            country:"USA"
        }

        //this would throw an error
            /*myEmployeeObject = {
                name:"Mary"
                age:39
                country: "UK" 
            } */

        myEmployeeObject.country="Finland"; //you can't mutated whole consts, but you can mutate their properties (like the country property here)
        console.log (myEmployeeObject.country); //logs Finland

         //being able to mutate the properties of the objects inside consts makes more sense when you think about selecting html elements: if you could not change any property of an element selected inside a const, that would kind of suck. But you can mutate the properties of an element inside of a const, you just cant reassign the entire const.

        //if using consts feels difficult, you can always use a let instead. A let will not give you any trouble with reasignments.
